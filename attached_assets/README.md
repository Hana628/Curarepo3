# Anomaly Detection in ECG Signals: Identifying Abnormal Heart Patterns Using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop an automated anomaly detection system for Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals using [Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)](what-is-LSTM.md) networks. The goal is to identify irregular heart patterns in real-time to support early diagnosis and improve patient outcomes.

## Problem Statement
The healthcare industry faces challenges in timely and accurate detection of cardiac anomalies, critical for preventing severe heart conditions. ECG signals generate large amounts of data, which makes manual analysis time-consuming and error-prone. This project uses deep learning to automate ECG anomaly detection, helping healthcare providers monitor patient health continuously.

## Key Objectives
- **Improving Patient Outcomes**: Early detection of heart conditions for timely medical intervention.
- **Enhancing Diagnostic Accuracy**: Using deep learning to identify subtle patterns that human doctors might overlook.
- **Efficient Resource Allocation**: Reducing clinician workload by flagging only critical cases.
- **Advancing Time Series Analysis**: Applying machine learning to ECG data, a valuable skill across industries.

## Components
### Software Components:
- Python
- TensorFlow or Keras
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

### Hardware Components:
- Laptop with sufficient processing power
- ECG dataset from sources like Kaggle or TensorFlow

## Methodology
1. **Data Extraction**: Load ECG data from TensorFlow datasets for preprocessing.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize the dataset and identify missing values.
3. **Preprocessing**: Clean and split the dataset for model training.
4. **Feature Extraction**: Select meaningful features from ECG signals.
5. **Model Building**: Construct and train an LSTM model for anomaly detection.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for performance evaluation.
